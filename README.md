# Overview

This README contains all information on how to run 24BrainMRI_Preprocessing(24BMP for short), a preprocessing pipeline for *Development of an early Prognosis prediction model for Central Nervous System Infections using AI-based analysis of Brain MRIs*.

Above is the 24BMP Pipeline. The 24BMP pipeline consists of three main parts for **Resampling**, **Segmentation** and **Brainpart Extraction**. The **Resampling** Part relies entirely on the resampling method used in lab2im, and the **Segmentation Part** on FastSurferCNN. Both libraries are cited in the bottom of the README.
